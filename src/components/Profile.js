      <p className="role-details">After graduating from Pepperdine University in 2012, I began working as a Logistics Coordinator for a large oil and gas construction company. This was after a brief, 6 month stint working offshore on an oil rig as a Roustabout. Since my oil and gas days, I have worked at a 3rd party logistics firm in Dallas and a Healthcare construction company. This is where the bulk of my experience lies, in the Healthcare commercial construction project management industry. I worked for 2.5 years as an Project Engineer/Assistant Project Manager before listening to my desire for a career change into Web Development!</p>
